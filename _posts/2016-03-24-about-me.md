About Me

An enthusiastic female photographer who is married with 2 cats. I live in a small seaside town on the South Coast of England. I find inspiration and grab the camera. I love all sorts of styles but prefer Minimalistic Landscapes & Seascapes. I also love to capture a part of a scene rather than the whole view.
