Iceland: A Photographer's Dream March, 2016\.

Last year my husband and I celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary. As part of that special event we decided we would book a holiday to Iceland. We originally intended to travel there for Christmas and New Year, however we were thwarted by leaving it too late to book, thus we could only achieve 7 days. In hindsight this was in our favour, even if a little disappointed at the time. Travelling to Iceland in March would be much better...longer days for starters.

With much preparation, research and general internet surfing, we were ready to head off on our Icelandic adventure. Full of anticipation, excitement and just not knowing what to expect once we arrived. We weren't disappointed with what awaited us...
