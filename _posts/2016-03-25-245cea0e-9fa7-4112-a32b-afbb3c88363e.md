About Me: Who Am I?

Essentially,  I am  an enthusiastic photographer living in a small seaside town on the South Coast of England. I'm married to a wonderful man and we live with two cats. I love to be inspired by the land and capture what I see in my own way. Primarily landscapes and seascapes are what pushes my buttons. At the moment I'm venturing down the Minimalist path.
