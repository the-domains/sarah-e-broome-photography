Creative : Turning my images into art.

I've been looking for ways to bring my photography to the next step, not just capturing an image and then printing it out. After lots of um-ming and ah-ing I think I've settled on what I want to do. Mixed media with encaustic is the direction I want to take it. So, I've been building up lots of points of reference "sketches" with my iPhone. That's the way I like to think of my images captured with my phone camera...it's my sketch book.

This is a little sketch I produced, it will be my first project.
